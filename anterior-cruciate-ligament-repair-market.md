<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anterior Cruciate Ligament Repair Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autograft</li><li>Allograft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair market primarily includes two types of grafts: autografts and allografts. Autografts involve using tissues from the patientâ€™s own body, often sourced from the patellar tendon or hamstring, which can enhance healing and reduce rejection risks.
